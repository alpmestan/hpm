hpm - Haskell Password Manager
==============================

hpm is my humble attempt at creating a simple, lightweight password
management application.
hpm is vanilla : there is no fancy add-ons, useless features,
etc. Namely, hpm won't sync with external *data-sucking* servers nor
will it ask you to *Like it* or *Tweet it* or whatever ; sometimes
things should do what they were intended to do, hpm is a password
manager, so it will store and manage your passwords.
You can start using really long and hard to guess passwords for
everything, as it will hpm's job to remember them for you.

Project initialization. I am going back to Haskell, and this is a
recover project. Looks awesome.
